## Hi ## 

For flashing the seeedunio you need some preperations.

Here are the instructions for the Arduino IDE:

	Add URL for additional Boards in the preferences:
	http://digistump.com/package_digistump_index.json,https://files.seeedstudio.com/arduino/package_seeeduino_boards_index.json

	Go to Tools > board > board manager and install "Seeed SAMD Boards" (I used version 1.8.5)

	Go to Tools > manage librarys and install "Adafruit NeoPixel" (I used verison 1.10.6)

	Select the board: Tool > Board:"" > Seeed SAMD > Seeedunio XAIO

	Also remember to use the correct serial com port
